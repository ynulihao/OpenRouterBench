## News

**[2025.08.20]** 🚀 **FusionFactory** & **FusionBench** are here! Most LLM apps still rely on a single model — limiting capability & wasting tokens. **FusionBench** (14 tasks, 5 domains, 20 LLMs, 103M tokens) + **FusionFactory** (query-, thought-, and model-level fusion) unlock powerful multi-LLM collaboration. ✅ Results: FusionFactory consistently outperforms the best single LLM across 14 benchmarks. 📄 [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10540?) | 💻 [Code](https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/FusionFactory) | 🐦 [Twitter](https://x.com/taofeng_uiuc)

**[2025.06.18]** 🔥 **Router-R1** has officially been released, which is a cutting-edge, reinforcement learning-driven LLM router designed to enable seamless collaboration among multiple LLMs to tackle complex problems efficiently. Explore the project and get started here: [Router-R1](https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/Router-R1).

## ⭐Experiments


### Training and Evaluation

Run experiments and print/save evaluation results on metrics Performance, Cost, and Reward. You can edit the hyperparameters in `configs/config.yaml` or using your own config_file.


```bash
python run_exp.py --config_file [config]
```

### Tricks for Adapting GraphRouter to Other Tasks and Datasets

1. **Embedding Normalization**  
   - Check whether input embeddings are normalized.  
   - On some datasets, skipping normalization leads to suboptimal results.  

2. **Network Initialization**  
   - Experiment with different initialization methods.  
   - Try varying random seeds or using alternative initialization schemes.  

3. **Model Saving Strategy**  
   - Instead of saving models based on highest accuracy, save checkpoints with the best evaluation set performance.  
   - This can yield better results on certain tasks.  

4. **Learning Rate Tuning**  
   - Adjust learning rate carefully.  
   - Slightly increasing it may help avoid local optima and improve stability.

## Modifications for LLMRouterBench Integration

### Train/Validation/Test Split Logic

**Date**: 2025-10-16

**Modified File**: `model/multi_task_graph_router.py` - `split_data()` method

**Reason for Modification**:

The original GraphRouter implementation assumed data was uniformly distributed across tasks and used simple row-based indexing for splitting. This caused issues when:

1. Different datasets have varying numbers of samples
2. Data from different tasks are stored consecutively in the CSV
3. The `task_id` column in the CSV was completely ignored

This led to incorrect train/test splits where samples from the same dataset could appear in both training and testing sets, causing data leakage.

**Changes Made**:

- Modified `split_data()` to group data by the `task_id` column in the CSV
- Each real task (dataset) is now split independently using the configured `split_ratio` (70%/10%/20%)
- Removed dependency on the `num_task` config parameter (now inferred from data)
- Commented out `num_task` in `configs/config.yaml` as it is no longer needed
- All other logic (label generation, mask creation, edge construction) remains unchanged

**Benefits**:

- ✅ Prevents data leakage between train/test sets
- ✅ Each dataset maintains its integrity during splitting
- ✅ More robust for datasets with varying sample sizes
- ✅ Respects the semantic meaning of `task_id` in the data

**Example Split Result** (for LLMRouterBench data):

```
Dataset         Queries  Train Q  Val Q  Test Q  Train Rows  Val Rows  Test Rows
aime                 60       42      6      12         294       42         84
gpqa                198      138     19      41         966      133        287
hle                 500      350     50     100        2450      350        700
livecodebench      1055      738    105     212        5166      735       1484
simpleqa            500      350     50     100        2450      350        700
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total              2313     1618    230     465       11326     1610       3255

Note: Each query corresponds to 7 rows (7 model evaluations), ensuring all
row counts are divisible by 7 for proper tensor reshaping during training.
```

**Backward Compatibility**:

- The modification does not affect the training process or model architecture
- Only the data splitting logic is changed
- If your data is already uniformly distributed and properly ordered, results should be similar
- For heterogeneous multi-dataset scenarios (like LLMRouterBench), this fix is essential

### Multi-Positive Label for Tied Optimal LLMs

**Date**: 2025-10-16

**Modified File**: `model/multi_task_graph_router.py` - `split_data()` method (label generation)

**Problem Identified**:

Data analysis revealed that **87.38%** of queries have tied optimal LLMs:
- 40.99% of queries: all 7 models tied (effect = 0.0)
- Only 12.62% of queries: unique optimal LLM

The original implementation used `np.argmax()` which:
- Always selects the first occurrence when ties exist
- Creates systematic bias toward low-index models (41% of labels forced to model 0)
- Discards information about "multiple equally good models"

**Original Behavior** (line 103):
```python
self.label = np.eye(self.num_llms)[np.argmax(effect_re, axis=1)].reshape(-1, 1)
```

Example issues:
- Query `[0.5, 0.5, 0.3, 0.3]` → Label `[1, 0, 0, 0]` ❌ (model 1 also optimal)
- Query `[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]` → Label `[1, 0, 0, 0]` ❌ (all equally bad)

**Changes Made**:

Replaced one-hot labels with multi-hot labels:
```python
row_max = effect_re.max(axis=1, keepdims=True)
ties = np.isclose(effect_re, row_max, rtol=0.0, atol=1e-8)
self.label = ties.astype(np.float32).reshape(-1, 1)
```

Example improvements:
- Query `[0.5, 0.5, 0.3, 0.3]` → Label `[1, 1, 0, 0]` ✅
- Query `[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]` → Label `[1, 1, 1, 1]` ✅

**Benefits**:

- ✅ Eliminates systematic bias toward low-index models
- ✅ Preserves information about all optimal choices
- ✅ More accurate training signal (87% of queries benefit)
- ✅ No change needed to loss function (BCE still works for multi-label)
- ✅ No change to inference (argmax still selects from optimal set)

**Impact on Performance**:

This addresses the root cause of GraphRouter performing worse than random selection: the training labels were systematically biased and inconsistent with the true optimal set.
